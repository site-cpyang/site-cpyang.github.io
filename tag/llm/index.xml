      <title>SanAssist: LLM-Powered Healthcare Data Dashboard</title>
      <link>https://site-cpyang.github.io/project/sanassist/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SanAssist is an innovative web application that empowers healthcare professionals with seamless data analysis and natural language querying. The platform combines interactive dashboards built with the Squirrels library and a fine-tuned GPT-2 model (via LoRA) to deliver context-aware insights from patient datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system includes a complete ETL pipeline (Databricks + Pandas) for data ingestion, transformation, and storage, connected to a lightweight Python microservice. Healthcare professionals can upload datasets, explore interactive charts and tables, and query the integrated chatbot for insights like &lt;em&gt;“Which patients are at the highest risk for sepsis?”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SanAssist is fully containerized with Docker, deployed on AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and App Runner, and automated via GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines. Load tests with 10,000 concurrent users confirmed scalability, with peak throughput of 602 RPS. The fine-tuned model achieved a perplexity score of &lt;strong&gt;3.32&lt;/strong&gt;, outperforming general-purpose medical LLMs such as Med-PaLM in domain-specific accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a robust data pipeline, secure deployment, and intuitive interface, SanAssist demonstrates how LLMs can transform healthcare analytics, bridging the gap between raw data and actionable clinical insights.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Duke ProfMatch: AI-Powered Research Collaboration Tool</title>
      <link>https://site-cpyang.github.io/project/profmatch/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Duke ProfMatch is an AI-powered platform designed to connect students with professors whose research aligns with their interests. Inspired by the difficulty students face in identifying potential collaborators, the tool uses natural language queries to return curated lists of professors along with details on their research, publications, and contact information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG), Neo4j, and OpenAI models, ProfMatch features a visual graph of Duke’s academic network, allowing users to explore connections across departments, schools, and research areas. The system was created by transforming Scholars@Duke data into a graph database, integrating prompt-engineered retrieval pipelines, and deploying a Streamlit frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProfMatch makes academic networking more accessible and engaging, with future plans to expand to other universities and add advanced features such as keyword alerts, collaboration suggestions, and improved AI-driven matching.&lt;/p&gt;
